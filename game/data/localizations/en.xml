<string name='player_intro_1'>What on earth just happened?!</string>
<string name='player_intro_2'>That was far from angelic!</string>
<string name='player_intro_3'>Falling from the heavans really gives you a sore butt!</string>
<string name='player_intro_4'>Nevermind. Let me just fly back up to the clouds where I belong.</string>
<string name='player_intro_5'></string>
<string name='player_intro_6'>My wings! They've disappeared! I can't hear anything!</string>
<string name='player_intro_7'>OK, stay calm. All I have to do is perform some good deeds, and win enough feathers to regain my wings. Many angels have done this in the past...</string>
<string name='player_intro_8'>Perhaps this man needs something. Darius to the rescue!</string>
<string name='jim_1_1'>Morning! Can I help you with anything?</string>
<string name='jim_1_2'>Hey kid. I'm Jim. Say, why are you naked?! Put on some coveralls or you'll catch a cold! There are some over there in that closet.</string>
<string name='jim_1_3'></string>
<string name='jim_1_4'></string>
<string name='jim_1_5'></string>

<string name='jim_1_7'></string>
<string name='jim_1_8'></string>
<string name='jim_1_9'></string>
<string name='jim_2_1'>Ah, he wants me to find some coveralls!</string>
<string name='jim_3_1'>Thanks, that's much better!</string>
<string name='jim_3_2'>I get feathers for my wings in return for doing good deeds.</string>
<string name='jim_3_3'>Would you mind looking for my cat Mittens? He's lost somewhere in the city!</string>
<string name='jim_3_4'>Of course!</string>
<string name='jim_4_1'>Kid, have you found my cat Mittens?</string>
<string name='jim_4_2'>Jim really loves that cat.</string>
<string name='jim_5_1'></string>
<string name='jim_5_2'></string>
<string name='jim_6_1'>Oh, my beloved cat Mittens! Thank you!</string>
<string name='jim_7_1'>Sorry, I can't hearing you. </string>
<string name='jim_7_1A'>Can you speak louder?</string>
<string name='jim_7_1B'>Perhaps, I need a hearing aid</string>
<string name='jim_7_1C'>I should look for a battery for my hearing aid</string>
<string name='michael_1_1'>Good morning!</string>
<string name='michael_1_2'>Good morning?! I'm leaving this horrible town. Love has driven me to leave!</string>
<string name='michael_1_3'>Why is your head fuming?</string>
<string name='michael_1_4'>The sun burns my head and my heard. And the bus is over two hours late!</string>
<string name='michael_1_5'>Is there anything I could do to help you?</string>
<string name='michael_1_6'>Would you mind delivering this love letter to the girl at a restaurant? I'm too shy to do it, myself.</string>
<string name='michael_1_7'>Sure thing!</string>
<string name='michael_2_1'>I have a letter for you!</string>
<string name='michael_2_2'>I didn't expect her to ever read my letter. Now I'm nervous!</string>
<string name='michael_2_3'>What did she say?</string>
<string name='michael_2_4'>I'm going to cry!</string>
<string name='michael_2_5'>Aw, did she say you're ugly?</string>
<string name='michael_2_6'>You think I'm ugly?!</string>
<string name='michael_2_7'>No no no!</string>
<string name='michael_2_8'>Actually, she said she loved my letter and wants to know more about me! These are tears of joy!</string>
<string name='michael_2_9'>Great! My first success as an angel!</string>
<string name='michael_2_10'>But you told me I'm ugly. Now I'm nervous again! Give a photo of me.</string>
<string name='michael_2_11'></string>
<string name='michael_3_1'>Have you got a response to my love letter?</string>
<string name='michael_3_2'>Not yet. Be patient!</string>
<string name='michael_4_1'>An angel fallen from heaven!</string>
<string name='michael_4_2'>Finally, you've figured it out!</string>
<string name='michael_4_3'>No, the girl in that photo</string>
<string name='michael_4_4'>Her name is Petra</string>
<string name='michael_4_5'>Ah, I'm pretty shy, kid. I've only admired her from afar.</string>
<string name='michael_5_1'></string>
<string name='michael_5_2'></string>
<string name='michael_6_1'>Ah, something to cover my head.</string>
<string name='michael_6_2'></string>
<string name='michael_7_1'>Do you know her yet?</string>
<string name='michael_7_2'>No - we should exchange a gift first.</string>
<string name='michael_7_3'></string>
<string name='michael_8_1'></string>
<string name='michael_8_2'></string>
<string name='michael_9_1'>How's it going?</string>
<string name='michael_9_2'>The truth is that we are so shy that we haven't ever spoken to eachother, but we are very happy</string>
<string name='michael_9_3'></string>
<string name='michael_9_4'></string>
<string name='michael_9_5'></string>
<string name='michael_9_6'></string>
<string name='michael_10_1'>I have your photo for Petra. Not bad!</string>
<string name='michael_10_2'>Have you given Petra my photo, yet? What did she say?</string>
<string name='michael_11_1'>Not yet. Be patient.</string>
<string name='michael_11_2'></string>
<string name='michael_12_1'>What is Michael trying to tell me?</string>
<string name='michael_12_1A'>I didn't quite catch that. Something about love?</string>
<string name='michael_12_1B'>Could you turn to face me, please?</string>
<string name='petra_1_1'>Hello!</string>
<string name='petra_1_2'>...</string>
<string name='petra_1_3'>Hello!</string>

<string name='petra_1_10'></string>

<string name='petra_1_12'></string>
<string name='petra_1_13'></string>
<string name='petra_1_14'></string>
<string name='petra_1_15'>I have a letter for you</string>
<string name='petra_1_16'>A letter? How strange!</string>
<string name='petra_1_17'>I hope you like it</string>
<string name='petra_1_18'>Hmm, seems well written</string>
<string name='petra_1_19'>Well?</string>
<string name='petra_1_20'>Whoever wrote this seems like a lovely person! Probably very attractive too!</string>
<string name='petra_1_21'>Of course!</string>
<string name='petra_2_1'>Hello. Is there anything I can help you with?</string>
<string name='petra_2_2'>No no. Just let me read my book.</string>
<string name='petra_2_3'>She's very focussed on that book</string>
<string name='petra_3_1'>Hey! That's Michael Spineless, the writer! I can't believe it!</string>
<string name='petra_3_2'></string>
<string name='petra_3_3'></string>
<string name='petra_3_4'></string>
<string name='petra_3_5'></string>
<string name='petra_3_6'>Would you like to meet him?</string>
<string name='petra_3_7'>Yes, of course!</string>
<string name='petra_3_8'></string>
<string name='petra_4_1'>How amazing!</string>
<string name='petra_4_2'></string>
<string name='petra_5_1'>It couldn't be?!</string>
<string name='petra_5_2'>What?</string>
<string name='petra_5_3'>This is the latest book by Michael Spineless!</string>
<string name='petra_5_4'>Do you like it?</string>
<string name='petra_5_5'>Of course! It's a very special book.</string>
<string name='petra_5_6'>Well, I hope everything has a happy ending!</string>
<string name='petra_6_1'>I should give him a gift in return</string>
<string name='petra_6_2'>That's my business - don't worry.</string>
<string name='petra_7_1'>I'd love to meet him!</string>
<string name='petra_7_2'>Well, I hope everything has a happy ending!</string>
<string name='petra_8_1'>Do you think he likes my photo?</string>
<string name='petra_8_2'>Sure</string>
<string name='petra_9_1'>Great, nice photo!</string>
<string name='petra_10_1'></string>
<string name='petra_10_2'></string>
<string name='petra_11_1'>Hello??</string>
<string name='petra_11_1A'>Sorry, could you look up from your book when you are talking to me?</string>
<string name='petra_11_1B'>Better I don't tell nothing</string>
<string name='paul_1_1'>Hello! Anyone here in need of a good deed?</string>
<string name='paul_1_2'>Sorry for the noise ... Yes, Sure, right here, kid! It would be nice some help</string>
<string name='paul_1_3'>Hmm, I don't know anything about cars, actually.</string>
<string name='paul_1_4'>I don't need help with the car. My wife Katty is very busy and I'm afraid she's forgotten our anniversary lunch!</string>
<string name='paul_1_5'>Should I call her?</string>
<string name='paul_1_6'>No, but could you find me a mobile phone?</string>
<string name='paul_1_7'>OK</string>
<string name='paul_2_1'>Here! A cell phone for you.</string>
<string name='paul_2_2'>Perfect! I was getting nervous.</string>
<string name='paul_2_3'></string>
<string name='paul_2_4'></string>
<string name='paul_2_5'></string>
<string name='paul_2_6'>Hi Katty! I'm just calling you to remind you of our anniversary lunch in the restaurant, today!</string>
<string name='paul_2_7'></string>
<string name='paul_2_8'>Surpised? You told me that restaurant was your favourite a few months ago! See you later, my love.</string>
<string name='paul_2_9'></string>
<string name='paul_2_10'></string>
<string name='paul_2_11'></string>
<string name='paul_2_12'></string>
<string name='paul_2_13'></string>
<string name='paul_2_14'></string>
<string name='paul_2_15'></string>
<string name='paul_2_16'></string>
<string name='paul_2_17'>Is everything OK?</string>
<string name='paul_2_18'>Yes - as soon as she's done in the library we'll go to the restaurant. Thanks for the phone!</string>
<string name='paul_2_19'>You're welcome!</string>
<string name='paul_3_1'>Have you found me a mobile phone?</string>
<string name='paul_3_2'>I'm working on it...</string>
<string name='paul_4_1'>I'm hungry. I sure hope Katty arrives on time!</string>
<string name='paul_4_2'></string>
<string name='paul_5_1'>I think the food is nearly ready! The chef would like to ask you if you could add some special ingredients.</string>
<string name='paul_5_2'>I really love potatoes.</string>
<string name='paul_5_3'></string>
<string name='paul_5_4'></string>
<string name='paul_5_5'></string>
<string name='paul_6_1'>The potatoes look amazing!</string>
<string name='paul_6_2'></string>
<string name='paul_6_3'>You've helped us so much. We would like to give you a present as way of thanks: the grandpa O'Paul's pliers.</string>
<string name='paul_6_4'></string>
<string name='paul_6_5'></string>
<string name='paul_6_6'></string>
<string name='paul_6_7'></string>
<string name='paul_6_8'></string>
<string name='paul_6_9'></string>
<string name='paul_7_1'>Perfect. It will be a grand feast!</string>
<string name='paul_7_2'></string>
<string name='paul_8_1'>What about the potatoes?</string>
<string name='paul_8_2'>Go go!</string>
<string name='paul_9_1'>I'm so hungry! Where's the chef?</string>
<string name='paul_10_1'>Sorry, I didn’t catch that. Could you turn that loud machine off?</string>
<string name='paul_10_1A'>Invite Paul to turn off the radio</string>
<string name='paul_10_1B'>Try to follow the conversation with Paul</string>
<string name='katty_1_1'>Oh dear, it's happened again!</string>
<string name='katty_1_2'>What happened?</string>
<string name='katty_1_3'>I'm trying to compile and encyclopaedia with ten red books, but they seem to have disappeared. I can't find them anywhere!</string>
<string name='katty_1_4'>I can help you find them</string>
<string name='katty_1_5'>Thanks!</string>
<string name='katty_2_1'>Done!</string>
<string name='katty_2_2'></string>
<string name='katty_2_3'></string>
<string name='katty_2_4'>Great! Thanks! Take this book as a gift. It's actually very rare.</string>
<string name='katty_2_5'></string>
<string name='katty_3_1'>#katty_1_3</string>
<string name='katty_3_2'>#katty_1_4</string>
<string name='katty_3_3'>#katty_1_5</string>
<string name='katty_4_1'>Oh, I need to go!</string>
<string name='katty_5_1'>I can't remember how Paul like's that dish. It might require some unusual ingredients. I'm not sure what though.</string>
<string name='katty_6_1'>Something else I can help you with, Katty?</string>
<string name='katty_6_2'>Some garlic and pepper would certainly give this dish a special flavour</string>
<string name='katty_6_3'>OK, let's do it!</string>
<string name='katty_7_1'>#katty_5_1</string>
<string name='katty_8_1'>#katty_6_1</string>
<string name='katty_8_2'>#katty_6_2</string>
<string name='katty_8_3'>#katty_6_3</string>
<string name='katty_9_1'>Subperb!</string>
<string name='katty_10_1'>Another ingredient! One more to go!</string>
<string name='francoise_1_1'></string>
<string name='francoise_1_2'></string>
<string name='francoise_2_1'>How's it going?</string>
<string name='francoise_2_2'>I'm about to have a nervous breakdown! They've asked for a dish with a lot of ingredietns, and I don't have tomatoes, celery, or parsley!</string>
<string name='francoise_2_3'></string>
<string name='francoise_2_4'></string>
<string name='francoise_2_5'></string>
<string name='francoise_2_6'></string>
<string name='francoise_2_7'>OK!</string>
<string name='francoise_3_1'>Here are the ingredients you asked for!</string>
<string name='francoise_3_2'>Thanks!</string>
<string name='francoise_4_1'>Here are your ingredients.</string>
<string name='francoise_4_2'>Sorry to bother you, but would you mind helping me again?</string>
<string name='francoise_4_3'>I'm in angel - that's my job!</string>
<string name='francoise_4_4'>Can you ask them what ingredients they would add to the dish?</string>
<string name='francoise_4_5'>How professional of you.</string>
<string name='francoise_4_6'>Also, I'm not sure that the dish is cooked very well, so I'm hoping some extra flavours will help diguise the bad cooking!</string>
<string name='francoise_4_7'>That isn't so professional...</string>
<string name='francoise_5_1'>What do you need now?</string>
<string name='francoise_5_2'>Tomato, celery, and parsley.</string>
<string name='francoise_6_1'>Can you ask them what ingredients they would add to the dish?</string>
<string name='francoise_6_2'></string>
<string name='francoise_7_1'>This cookbook is excellent. I can be a great chef, now!</string>
<string name='francoise_7_2'></string>
<string name='francoise_8_1'></string>
<string name='francoise_8_2'></string>
<string name='francoise_8_3'>A cookbook would be perfect</string>
<string name='francoise_8_4'>If I find something appropriate, I will give it to you.</string>
<string name='francoise_9_1'></string>
<string name='francoise_9_2'></string>
<string name='joseph_1_1'>Waiter! I've been waiting for over an hour!</string>
<string name='joseph_1_2'>I'm not the waiter</string>
<string name='joseph_1_3'>I don't care</string>
<string name='joseph_1_4'>I'll see what I can do, sir</string>
<string name='joseph_1_5'>I need some sugar and a spoon. I need my coffee before I open the store!</string>
<string name='joseph_1_6'>OK, I'll ask the chef</string>
<string name='joseph_1_7'></string>
<string name='joseph_1_8'></string>
<string name='joseph_2_1'>Thanks, although the coffee should be cheaper. It's not very nice!</string>
<string name='joseph_2_2'></string>
<string name='joseph_2_3'></string>
<string name='joseph_2_4'></string>
<string name='joseph_2_5'></string>
<string name='joseph_3_1'>If I don't get that sugar and a spoon I won't be able to have my coffee before I have to open the store!</string>
<string name='joseph_3_2'></string>
<string name='joseph_4_1'>Oh, the waiter has come back</string>
<string name='joseph_4_2'>I'm not the waiter! I'm not even in the restaurant!</string>
<string name='joseph_4_3'>Hmm, that's true. You're in my store. And right now you're the worst employee of the month. If you order the shelf, I'll give you a smartphone.</string>
<string name='joseph_4_4'>Sort the mobiles following this color rule that I will tell you now</string>
<string name='joseph_4_5'>Le't go, listen...</string>
<string name='joseph_4_6'></string>
<string name='joseph_4_7'></string>
<string name='joseph_5_1'>Done! I hope you enjoy your amazing phone that you don't even deserve.</string>
<string name='joseph_5_2'></string>
<string name='joseph_5_3'></string>
<string name='joseph_5_4'></string>
<string name='joseph_5_5'></string>
<string name='joseph_6_1'>What are you waiting for? Put these phones up on the shelf! Get to it!</string>
<string name='joseph_7_1'></string>
<string name='joseph_7_2'></string>
<string name='joseph_7_3'></string>
<string name='joseph_8_1'>What a mess! You'll have to start again. Listen...</string>
<string name='joseph_color_blue'>Blue</string>
<string name='joseph_color_green'>Green</string>
<string name='joseph_color_orange'>Orange</string>
<string name='joseph_color_yellow'>Yellow</string>
<string name='joseph_color_red'>Red</string>
<string name='joseph_9_1'>I do not understand you...</string>
<string name='joseph_9_1A'>Can you turn off that radio, please?</string>
<string name='joseph_9_1B'>Can you repeat it, please?</string>
<string name='mobile_shelving_1'>Drop and sort here the mobiles that are in your inventary</string>
<string name='price_1_1'>Hi! How are you doing?</string>
<string name='price_1_2'>That didn’t work, maybe I should try drying it out</string>
<string name='price_1_3'></string>
<string name='price_1_4'></string>
<string name='price_1_5'></string>
<string name='price_1_6'>Oh, no. I'm looking for my friend, the Talking Fish. He has been missing over two days. I use this fishing rod for feeding him...</string>
<string name='price_1_7'>Wow, I had never heard anything like this. Never.</string>
<string name='price_1_8'>He's lovely...</string>
<string name='price_1_9'></string>
<string name='price_2_1'>My friend, the fish, has come back! I'm so happy!</string>
<string name='price_2_2'>Thank this angel, he set me free.</string>
<string name='price_2_3'></string>
<string name='price_2_4'></string>
<string name='price_2_5'>Thank you for your good work. You can use my boat if you need it!</string>
<string name='price_2_6'>Great! Thank you so much!</string>
<string name='price_3_1'>I'm worried. What could have happened to my friend the fish? I'd like to see him free again...</string>
<string name='price_3_2'>A new investigation opened for the angel investigator!</string>
<string name='price_4_1'>You can take my boat to access the small island and find the village. People say a pirate hid a treasure there...</string>
<string name='price_4_2'>Sounds like a plan.</string>
<string name='price_5_1'>Hmmm, I can't seem to hear very well anymore      </string>
<string name='price_5_1A'>I think my hearing aid got wet. I should dry it!</string>
<string name='price_5_1B'>To slightly beat the hearing aid might work...</string>
<string name='fish_1_1'>What is this fish doing here?</string>
<string name='fish_1_2'>Help!</string>
<string name='fish_1_3'>What is this talking fish doing here?</string>
<string name='fish_1_4'>Help! An awful man put me in a bag and left me here. The fisherman who lives on the beach may be worried... Could you take me back to the sea, please?</string>
<string name='fish_1_5'>I'll see if I can...</string>
<string name='fish_2_1'></string>
<string name='fish_3_1'>Have you found a way to bring me back to my friend?</string>
<string name='fish_3_2'>No, sorry... I'm still working on it!</string>
<string name='fish_4_1'>You are free!</string>
<string name='fish_5_1'>Now, I can help Talking Fish!</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_1_1'>Hello, are you having fun?</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_1_2'>To be honest, no. We have been discussing for hours and getting nowhere.</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_1_3'>And I'm right!</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_1_4'></string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_1_5'>And what about the colour?</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_1_6'>Movement is key.</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_1_7'>And if there's no movement, how are cats to choose between two balls?</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_1_8'></string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_1_9'></string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_1_10'>Could you just play?</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_1_11'>We are playing.</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_1_12'></string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_2_1'>#mark_and_spencer_1_8</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_2_2'>#mark_and_spencer_1_9</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_2_3'>I think I can help you...</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_2_4'></string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_2_5'></string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_2_6'>I threw a green ball up in the air and the cat just ignored it...</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_2_7'>...</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_2_8'>...</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_2_9'></string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_2_10'></string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_2_11'>We should let it go and play soccer...</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_2_12'>Don't give up. That red ball might work.</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_2_13'></string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_2_14'>What should we do now? We need something to play with to design new methods. If you find something interesting the ball is yours.</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_2_15'>Let's see what can I do.</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_3_1'>Movement is the key.</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_3_2'>No! Colours are more important!</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_3_3'>The young scientists continue their theoretical discussion...</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_4_1'>Look!</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_4_2'>Superb! A frisbee!</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_4_3'>Are you gonna throw it?</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_4_4'>No, but let's discuss. What's more important to keep it in the air: speed or rotation?</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_4_5'>I think the most important is the surface!</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_4_6'>The frisbee is more interesting than the ball. You can have it.</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_4_7'></string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_5_1'>Have you found something to keep us busy? An object that defies gravity?</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_5_2'>Guys, just give me the red ball to try with the cat.</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_5_3'>Just give me the red ball, please.</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_5_4'>No, you've ruined our theoretical discussion!</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_6_1'></string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_6_2'>Yes, we've concluded that a new theoretical physical law can be built on our observations of the frisbee.</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_6_3'>We have a few ideas for producing new and faster aeroplanes!</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_6_4'></string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_6_5'></string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_6_6'></string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_7_1'>Something about colour? Something about movement?</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_7_1A'>Please, could you speak one at time?</string>
<string name='mark_and_spencer_7_1B'>I will try to ask them again</string>
<string name='cat_1_1'>A cat!</string>
<string name='cat_2_1'>... Ok, he doesn't obey me... He's a cat.</string>
<string name='cat_3_1'>He loves the red ball!</string>

<string name='pessimus_1_3'>Dear audience, can you see this moustache?</string>
<string name='pessimus_1_4'>Yes!</string>
<string name='pessimus_1_5'>It's fake!</string>
<string name='pessimus_1_6'>...</string>
<string name='pessimus_1_7'>What the matter? No applause?</string>
<string name='pessimus_1_8'></string>
<string name='pessimus_1_9'>That's illusionism. The fake moustache is supposed to be real.</string>
<string name='pessimus_1_10'>Technically, yes. It's not funny. And the beard looks like a shaggy dog.</string>
<string name='pessimus_1_11'></string>
<string name='pessimus_1_12'></string>
<string name='pessimus_1_13'>I'm a mess. Nobody wants to see my show.</string>
<string name='pessimus_1_14'>Don't panic. I'm sure you know better tricks.</string>
<string name='pessimus_1_15'>I can perform a rabbit trick but I need a rabbit, or something similar.</string>
<string name='pessimus_1_16'>Hmmm... maybe, I have something that could work</string>
<string name='pessimus_2_1'>Do you think this one can work?</string>
<string name='pessimus_2_2'>Looks like the rabbit's ears.</string>
<string name='pessimus_3_1'>Look! She's lovely!</string>
<string name='pessimus_3_2'>Perfect! Her face looks like a rabbit.</string>
<string name='pessimus_4_1'>And this cotton ball is like a little tail.</string>

<string name='frostie_1_1'>Oh, yummy! An ice cream shop!</string>
<string name='frostie_1_2'>Yes, but it's a pretty boring job. I'm gonna start talking with the ice cream. </string>
<string name='frostie_1_3'>I'd like to have a friend for having fun with.</string>
<string name='frostie_1_4'></string>
<string name='frostie_1_5'>I'll look for a solution.</string>

<string name='landon_1_1'>Hello, can I help you?</string>
<string name='landon_1_2'>Go to the city. There you can help many people and win back your wings.</string>
<string name='landon_1_3'>Why? Do you know that for sure?</string>
<string name='landon_1_4'></string>
<string name='landon_1_5'>Well, no. I'm an angel, not a fortune teller!</string>
<string name='landon_1_6'>Well said! It would be great if you brought me ten apples.</string>
<string name='landon_1_7'>Ok!</string>
<string name='landon_2_1'>Here are the apples!</string>
<string name='landon_2_2'>Thanks!</string>
<string name='landon_2_3'>What are you doing here?</string>
<string name='landon_2_4'>I'm waiting for someone who needs my assistance.</string>
<string name='landon_2_5'></string>
<string name='landon_3_1'>It would be great if you brought me ten apples.</string>
<string name='landon_3_2'>Ok.</string>
<string name='landon_4_1'>At last, you are here...</string>
<string name='landon_4_2'>What's happening?</string>
<string name='landon_4_3'>It's all very well to help others, but I bet you were focussed on getting new feathers, instead of helping make the world better. You heard them badly because you're not interested in their problems; only your own.</string>
<string name='landon_4_4'></string>
<string name='landon_4_5'></string>
<string name='landon_4_6'>I know, but how I can distinguish when I'm doing good things for myself or others? I'm an angel: to help people is in my nature.</string>
<string name='landon_4_7'>You must learn to listen and go with the flow. You will find a statue at the city entrance: there you can see what I did to get my wings. You will need this level.</string>
<string name='landon_4_8'></string>
<string name='landon_4_9'></string>
<string name='landon_4_10'></string>
<string name='landon_4_11'></string>
<string name='landon_4_12'>Can try anyway...</string>
<string name='landon_5_1'>Has the person that needs you arrived?</string>
<string name='landon_5_2'>No, he is still finishing something.</string>
<string name='landon_5_3'></string>
<string name='landon_5_4'></string>
<string name='landon_6_1'>Have you solved the secret of the statue?</string>
<string name='landon_6_2'>I'm working on it. Do't rush me, please.</string>
<string name='landon_6_3'></string>
<string name='landon_6_4'></string>
<string name='statue_1_1'>Such a rare statue. What does it say? "Dedicated to our Guardian Angel". Wow, a colleague! There are three holes, are these for levers? I wonder what that means.</string>
<string name='statue_2_1'>Great! Oh, a secret pocket!</string>
<string name='statue_3_1'>Um... I need three levers</string>
<string name='statue_4_1'>I just need two more bars.</string>
<string name='statue_5_1'>Good, I still need one more.</string>
<string name='statue_6_1'>Great! Oh, a secret pocket!</string>
<string name='statue_7_1'>Maybe try a different order.</string>
<string name='ear_1_1'>What's that?!</string>
<string name='ear_1_2'>That's an ear to hear the world with. Are you ready to answer back?</string>
<string name='ear_1_3'>I'll do my best. Hearing aids would be very useful.</string>
<string name='strongoroff_1_1'>Welcome to the strongman show! Strongoroff The Almost Weak!</string>
<string name='strongoroff_1_2'>Wait, the false moustache...you're Pessimus the Mediocre!</string>

<string name='strongoroff_1_8'>Strongman? You don't look very strong...</string>
<string name='strongoroff_1_9'>Ha! I accept your challenge! Show me something heavy, such as a large rock, and I'll show you how strong I am!</string>
<string name='strongoroff_1_10'>This isn't going to end well...</string>
<string name='strongoroff_2_1'>That huge rock over there is perfect</string>
<string name='strongoroff_2_2'>I fear the worst...</string>
<string name='strongoroff_2_3'>Amazing!</string>

<string name='mime_1_1'>Pessimus again? Or, should I say, Strongoroff?</string>
<string name='mime_1_2'>Third time luck! Magic is not my strong suit, and I'm not that strong. I should be a mime or a clown. I'll be the mime that can also talk. The Great Talking Mime. That's original...</string>
<string name='mime_1_3'></string>
<string name='mime_1_4'></string>
<string name='mime_1_5'>Yes, well. I don't know. Sounds pretty confusing.</string>
<string name='mime_1_6'>Now I'm stuck in a glass cube!</string>
